In much of my work, I hope to expose gender-based bias in technology. This piece is a game that allows the user to deconstruct an image from an article that shows gender-based bias in the contemporary technology landscape. The image is deconstructed using only mouse clicks to the point that it becomes pixels that are smaller and smaller and then basically just noise. The noise is visually beautiful in some ways so the deconstruction uses absurdity to renders the image unbiased.
